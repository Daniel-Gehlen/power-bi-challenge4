# Report on Dimensional Modeling in the Educational Context

## Introduction

Dimensional modeling is a crucial technique in the field of Business Intelligence (BI) that allows for organizing and analyzing data efficiently for strategic decision-making. In the educational context, this technique can be applied to analyze data related to teachers, courses, departments, and other relevant aspects of the educational institution.

In this report, we will explore the application of dimensional modeling in the educational context, highlighting the methods used, the results obtained, and the conclusions drawn on the subject.

## Methods

To apply dimensional modeling in the educational context, the following steps were followed:

1. Identification of data sources: Data related to teachers, courses, departments, and dates of course offerings were collected.
2. Definition of dimension and fact tables: Tables were created to represent each dimension (Professor, Course, Department, and Date) and a fact table (Professor_Course) to record the interaction between teachers and courses.
3. Development of the dimensional model: Power BI Desktop was used to create the dimensional model based on the defined tables.
4. Data analysis and visualization: The data was explored through visualizations and analyses to extract relevant insights.

## Results

The results obtained from the application of dimensional modeling in the educational context were as follows:

- Improved data organization: Data related to teachers, courses, and departments were structured in dimension tables.
- More efficient analyses: Dimensional modeling allowed for detailed analyses of the interaction between teachers and courses, identifying patterns and trends.
- Clear and informative visualizations: Visualizations created in Power BI Desktop provided a clear and informative representation of the data, facilitating understanding and decision-making.

## Conclusion

Dimensional modeling is a powerful tool for analyzing data in the educational context, providing valuable insights for managers, teachers, and other professionals in the field. By structuring data into dimension and fact tables, deeper and more accurate analyses can be performed, contributing to the continuous improvement of educational processes.

## Case Study

As a practical example, let us consider a university that aims to improve the performance of its courses. Using dimensional modeling, the university can analyze data on teacher evaluations, course workload, student performance, and other relevant factors. Based on these analyses, the institution can identify areas for improvement, adjust course curricula, offer training for teachers, and implement measures to increase student satisfaction and the quality of education.
